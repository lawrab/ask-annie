# Ask Annie - Project Brief

**Strapline:** *Your daily health companion. Track symptoms, spot patterns, empower your health.*

---

## Project Overview

Ask Annie is a health symptom tracking app designed to help people with undiagnosed or complex conditions track symptoms, identify patterns, and prepare for medical appointments. Built as a dedication to Annie Rabbets, the app is intuitive enough for anyone to use daily.

**Core Philosophy:** Simple daily check-ins via voice or quick selections, flexible symptom tracking, and meaningful trend analysis.

---

## User Problem

People with undiagnosed or mysterious health conditions struggle to:
- Remember symptom patterns when appointments come around
- Communicate the full scope of their experience to doctors
- Spot correlations between activities and symptoms
- Track evolving or new symptoms without rigid forms

Ask Annie solves this by being frictionless, flexible, and focused on what actually matters: patterns over time.

## Core Features

### 1. Daily Check-In (Primary Flow)
- **Trigger:** Push notification at customizable times (default: 8am, 2pm, 8pm)
- **Input Method:** Voice recording (Whisper transcription) OR quick multiple-choice fallback
- **Voice Flow:**
  - User taps notification
  - Big microphone button opens
  - Records 5-30 second voice memo
  - Backend transcribes with faster-whisper
  - AI parses transcript into structured symptoms
  - Confirmation: "Check-in saved!"
- **Fallback Multiple Choice:**
  - Hand Grip: Bad / Moderate / Good
  - Pain Level: 1-10 slider
  - Energy: Low / Medium / High
  - What stopped you: Nothing / Hand issues / Fatigue / Pain / Other
  - Activity level: Rested / Light / Normal / High

### 2. Dynamic Symptom Tracking
- Symptoms stored as flexible dictionary (not rigid schema)
- Common symptoms pre-populated, but any new symptom mentioned gets captured
- Example symptoms tracked: hand_grip, pain_level, raynauds_event, brain_fog, tingling_feet, neck_stiffness, etc.
- Symptoms are tracked as key-value pairs with values like: true/false, "mild"/"moderate"/"severe", 1-10, or freeform text

### 3. Dashboard & Trends
- **Timeline View:** All check-ins chronologically with raw transcripts
- **Symptom Analysis:** 
  - "Show me all entries with [symptom]"
  - Frequency: "Tingling in feet appeared in 40% of last 14 days' entries"
  - Severity trends: "Pain level average: 5.2, but 7.1 on high activity days"
  - Pattern detection: "You feel best on rest days"
- **Charts:** Simple line graphs for numeric symptoms (pain, energy) over time

### 4. Doctor Appointment Prep
- Flag entries as "important for doctor"
- Generate Doctor Summary:
  - Symptom timeline (when each symptom first appeared)
  - Frequency table (% of entries containing each symptom)
  - Severity trends
  - Correlations (activities/rest patterns affecting symptoms)
  - Export as JSON or printable PDF
  - Condensed format: fits on 1-2 pages

### 5. Settings
- Notification times (customizable)
- Notification toggle (on/off)
- Data export (download all entries as JSON)
- Clear all data (with confirmation)

## Voice Transcription Flow (Whisper Integration)

1. **Frontend:** Records audio → sends as FormData blob to backend
2. **Backend Receives:** Audio file at `/api/checkins` endpoint
3. **Whisper Processing:** 
   - Write audio to temp file
   - Run through faster-whisper model
   - Get transcript string
4. **Parsing Layer:**
   - Keyword matching pass (extract common symptoms)
   - If confidence < 80%, send to Claude API (optional): "Extract symptoms from this transcript: [transcript]. Return JSON with keys like: hand_grip, pain_level, etc."
   - Build structured symptoms object
5. **Storage:** Save to MongoDB with both raw transcript + structured data
6. **Response:** Return parsed data + confirmation to frontend

## Key Implementation Notes

### Offline Capability
- localStorage stores last check-in draft
- If network fails, app queues check-in for sync when online
- Background sync (Service Worker) can retry failed uploads

### Privacy
- All audio transcription happens server-side (never sent to third parties unless Claude API fallback used)
- Medical data stays in your MongoDB instance
- Users can export and delete all data anytime

### Scalability
- MongoDB handles thousands of check-ins per user
- Whisper transcription is CPU-bound, not memory-bound
- Consider adding job queue (Bull, Bee-Queue) if many concurrent users

### UX Polish
- Haptic feedback on mobile when recording
- Loading states during Whisper transcription
- Encouraging messages ("Great, 3 entries this week!")
- Skeleton loaders for dashboard data

## Claude Code Handoff Instructions

When starting with Claude Code:

1. **Begin with infrastructure setup** (Day 1-2 phase)
   - Clone starter Express/React templates
   - Wire up MongoDB connection
   - Deploy skeleton to Railway
   - Verify deployment works before building features

2. **Then tackle Whisper integration** (critical path)
   - This is the most complex part
   - Get it working locally first, then in production

3. **Frontend and backend endpoints can be built in parallel** once Whisper works

4. **Always test voice recording + transcription end-to-end** before moving to parsing logic

5. **Deploy frequently** (after each major feature) to catch deployment issues early

6. **Focus on the core loop first:**
   - Record voice → Transcribe → Parse → Store → Display
   - Everything else builds from there

---

## Success Criteria

- ✅ User can record voice check-in via notification
- ✅ Whisper transcribes accurately (>90% accuracy)
- ✅ Symptoms parsed dynamically (new symptoms captured automatically)
- ✅ Dashboard shows timeline + trends
- ✅ Doctor summary generated and exportable
- ✅ Mobile-friendly (responsive design)
- ✅ Works on iPhone Safari + Android Chrome
- ✅ Deployed on Railway with auto-deploy on GitHub push

---

## Nice-to-Haves (Post-Week Enhancements)

- Symptom correlations (ML: which activities correlate with worst days)
- Wearable integration (heart rate, steps correlating with symptoms)
- Medication logging + response tracking
- Multi-user household accounts
- Doctor sharing links (anonymized summary for sharing with medical team)
- Symptom severity predictions based on patterns
- Email summary digest (weekly recap)

---

## Questions for Clarity

Before starting, confirm:
1. ✅ Annie using this primarily on mobile or desktop? (assume mobile-first)
2. ✅ Need user authentication (multiple people) or single-user? (assume single for now, can add later)
3. ✅ Whisper model size: base (~140MB) or tiny (~39MB)? (recommend base for accuracy)
4. ✅ PDF export critical or JSON export sufficient? (start with JSON, add PDF if time)
