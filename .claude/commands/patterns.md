# Coding Patterns Quick Reference

Read the comprehensive coding patterns memory and show me examples of the most important patterns I should follow for this codebase.

Focus on:
1. Current controller/service patterns (backend)
2. Current component/page patterns (frontend)
3. Testing patterns for both
4. Common mistakes to avoid

If I'm about to implement something, help me find similar existing code to match its pattern.
