## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Podman (or Docker)
- Python 3.8+ (for faster-whisper)

### Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lrabbets/ask-annie.git
   cd ask-annie
   ```

2. **Start dependencies (MongoDB + Redis)**
   ```bash
   make deps-up
   ```
   This starts MongoDB on `localhost:27017` and Redis on `localhost:6379`

3. **Install npm dependencies**
   ```bash
   make install
   # Or manually:
   npm run install:all
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   # Backend
   cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
   # Edit backend/.env with your settings

   # Frontend
   cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env
   # Edit frontend/.env with your settings
   ```

5. **Start development servers**
   ```bash
   make dev
   ```
   This runs both backend and frontend with hot-reload enabled.

6. **Access the application**
   - Frontend: http://localhost:5173
   - Backend API: http://localhost:3000
   - Mongo Express UI: http://localhost:8081 (admin/admin)
